rebar
=====

rebar [3.0](#30) is an Erlang build tool that makes it easy to compile and test Erlang
applications, port drivers and releases.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rebar/rebar3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rebar/rebar3)

rebar is a self-contained Erlang script, so it's easy to distribute or even
embed directly in a project. Where possible, rebar uses standard Erlang/OTP
conventions for project structures, thus minimizing the amount of build
configuration work. rebar also provides dependency management, enabling
application writers to easily re-use common libraries from a variety of
locations (git, hg, etc).

3.0 Pre-Alpha
====

[DOCUMENTATION](http://www.rebar3.org/v3.0/docs)

This is an experimental branch, considered to be pre-alpha, and still
very unstable. Use at your own risk, and expect no support. See
[the related announcement](http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/rebar_lists.basho.com/2014-November/002087.html).

Compatibility with rebar 2.0 has been broken, and features removed to
limit scope.

### Providers

Providers are the modules that do the work to fulfill a user's command.

Example:

```erlang
-module(rebar_prv_something).

-behaviour(rebar_provider).

-export([init/1,
         do/1]).

-define(PROVIDER, something).
-define(DEPS, []).

-spec init(rebar_state:state()) -> {ok, rebar_state:state()}.
init(State) ->
    State1 = rebar_state:add_provider(State, rebar_provider:create([{name, ?PROVIDER},
                                                                    {module, ?MODULE},
                                                                    {bare, false},
                                                                    {deps, ?DEPS},
                                                                    {example, "rebar dummy"},
                                                                    {short_desc, "dummy plugin."},
                                                                    {desc, ""},
                                                                    {opts, []}])),
    {ok, State1}.

-spec do(rebar_state:state()) -> {ok, rebar_state:state()}.
do(State) ->
    %% Do something
    {ok, State}.
```


Building
--------

Recommended installation of [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org) is binary packages from [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp). For source it is recommended you use [erln8](http://metadave.github.io/erln8/) or [kerl](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl).

### Dependencies

To build rebar you will need a working installation of Erlang R15 (or later).

Should you want to clone the rebar repository, you will also require git.

#### Downloading

You can download a pre-built binary version of rebar3 based on the last commit from:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/rebar3/rebar3

#### Building rebar

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rebar/rebar3
$ cd rebar
$ ./bootstrap/bootstrap
==> rebar (compile)
Congratulations! You now have a self-contained script called "rebar" in
your current working directory. Place this script anywhere in your path
and you can use rebar to build OTP-compliant apps.
```
