rebar
=====

rebar [3.0](#30) is an Erlang build tool that makes it easy to compile and test Erlang
applications, port drivers and releases.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rebar/rebar3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rebar/rebar3) [![Windows build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yx4oitd9pvd2kab3?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/TristanSloughter/rebar3)

rebar is a self-contained Erlang script, so it's easy to distribute or even
embed directly in a project. Where possible, rebar uses standard Erlang/OTP
conventions for project structures, thus minimizing the amount of build
configuration work. rebar also provides dependency management, enabling
application writers to easily re-use common libraries from a variety of
locations ([hex.pm](http://hex.pm), git, hg, and so on).

### Changes

#### Since Rebar 2.x

* Fetches and builds deps if missing when running any command that relies on them
* Automatically recognizes `apps` and `lib` directory structure
* Relx for releases and relups
* deterministic builds and conflict resolution
* New plugin handling mechanism
* New hook mechanism
* Support for packages
* A ton more

### Gone

* Reltool integeration
* Quickcheck integration (moved to [a plugin](http://www.rebar3.org/v3.0/docs/using-available-plugins#quickcheck))
* C code compiling (moved to [a plugin](http://www.rebar3.org/v3.0/docs/using-available-plugins#port-compiler) or hooks)

### Providers

Providers are the modules that do the work to fulfill a user's command.

Example:

```erlang
-module(rebar_prv_something).

-behaviour(rebar_provider).

-export([init/1,
         do/1,
         format_error/1]).

-define(PROVIDER, something).
-define(DEPS, []).

-spec init(rebar_state:state()) -> {ok, rebar_state:state()}.
init(State) ->
    State1 = rebar_state:add_provider(State, rebar_provider:create([{name, ?PROVIDER},
                                                                    {module, ?MODULE},
                                                                    {bare, false},
                                                                    {deps, ?DEPS},
                                                                    {example, "rebar dummy"},
                                                                    {short_desc, "dummy plugin."},
                                                                    {desc, ""},
                                                                    {opts, []}])),
    {ok, State1}.

-spec do(rebar_state:state()) -> {ok, rebar_state:state()}.
do(State) ->
    %% Do something
    {ok, State}.

-spec format_error(any()) -> iolist().
format_error(Reason) ->
    io_lib:format("~p", [Reason]).
```


Building
--------

Recommended installation of [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org) is source built using [erln8](http://erln8.github.io/erln8/) or [kerl](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl). For binary packages use those provided by [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp), but be sure to choose the "Standard" download option or you'll have issues building projects.

### Dependencies

To build rebar you will need a working installation of Erlang R15 (or later).

Should you want to clone the rebar repository, you will also require git.

#### Downloading

You can download a pre-built binary version of rebar3 based on the last commit from:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/rebar3/rebar3

#### Bootstrapping rebar3

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rebar/rebar3
$ cd rebar3
$ ./bootstrap
```

### Developing on rebar3

When developing you can simply run `escriptize` to build your changes but the new escript is under `_build/default/bin/rebar3`

```sh
$ ./rebar3 escriptize
$ _build/default/bin/rebar3
```
